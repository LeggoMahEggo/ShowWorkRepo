# ShowWorkRepo
 These repos are some of the projects I have developed while working at Dicta (they may be updated in the interim)

# dicta-mobile-tests
 Unit tests written in Java and using JUnit to test the mobile version of Dicta's website
 
# disambiguation
 Command-line program (named D-CLIP) for preprocessing training data for Dicta's Nadkan tool (data itself is property of Dicta, and cannot be shown here)
  
# mispelled-author-search
 Proof-of-concept API for searching names of people, places, and books of the Footprints database, accounting for mistakes made in the search terms. (Footprints is a database that traces the history and movement of Jewish books since the inception of print)
